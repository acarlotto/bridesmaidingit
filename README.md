# Description of App
Bridesmaidingit! is an app that allows its users (typically someone in a wedding party) to create a user account and create a page with a list of todos to keep track of planning for all of the bridal events (example a bridal shower) leading up to the wedding. In a future version of this app the app will allow for a user (one member of the wedding party) to create the initial page of todos and then invite the rest of the wedding party to create an account to have access to that one page. Each todo task will be assigned to a particular person within the wedding party. Also, a future version of this app will allow users to check off each task as completed.
